As the array being passed into each function gets bigger and bigger, one functoin scales noticeably better than the other. The append function, which uses the .push method, is much faster with larger arrays than the insert function, which uses the .unshift method. This is because the .unshift method requires that each index of the array be shifted on each iteration of the array, while the .push method only requires that a value is appened onto the end of the array on each iteration.
